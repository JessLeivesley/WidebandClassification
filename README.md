# WidebandClassification

To run DNN
 - navigate to 1D Structure folder
 - run 1. Data Generation
 - navigate to Deep Neural Network Folder
 - to replicate hyperparameter tuning, run 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
 - to fit best model, run 3. Model Training

To run ResNet
 - navigate to 1D Structure folder
 - run 1. Data Generation
 - navigate to Residual Network Folder
 - run 2. Hyperparameter Tuning (this needs to be run for 3)
 - to fit best model, run 3. Model Training

To run 1D CNN
 - navigate to 1D Structure folder
 - run 1. Data Generation

To run RNN
 - navigate to Recurrent Neural Network folder
 - run 1. Data Preprocessing
 - to replicate hyperparameter tuning, run 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
 - to fit best model, run 3. Model Training

Data for 1. Data Preprocessing & 1. Data Generation stored as an RDS file in Data folder
